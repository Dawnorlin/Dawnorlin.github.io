<h2>About Me</h2>
  <p> I am a new SF resident as of 3 months ago! I moved here make new conenctions and experience "city life". I grew up in Santa Cruz, CA, and lived in Southern CA for 5 years, moving to Ventura to attend university, and then further South to San Diego. I moved back up North to be near friends & family. I enjoy surfing, yoga, my pets, being with friends, traveling, and trying new things! </p>



  <h2> My Professional/ Educational Experience</h2> 
  <p>I received my Bachelor's degree in Communication, emphasis in Health, in 2009 from CSU Channel Islands. I studied both the scientific side of healthcare including microbiology, biotechnology and nutritional physiology, as well as global healthcare and multicultrual perspectives of healthcare. I also studied various aspects of healthcare marketing as it relates to communication between healthcare providers, their patients, and pharmaceutical companies. I have historically worked in medical administration, working with insurance companies and managing patient accounts for several heathcare organizations.</p>
